                      One of the most important of the Gods, Ra is believed to
                      be the creator of the Universe and all life; he rules over
                      the Sky, The Earth, and the Underworld.<br /><br />
                      Ra would travel each day on his golden sun ship Mandjet
                      and at night he would travel through Duat (the underworld)
                      aboard his evening ship Meseket where he would battle the
                      evil giant serpent Apopis and other monsters. If he was
                      victorious Ra would emerge again aboard Mandjet and cause
                      another day to begin.<br /><br />
                      Ra is depicted in human form as a man with a sun disc
                      above his head with the disc often having a coiled serpent
                      around it. He is also seen as a man with the head of a
                      falcon or if he is travelling through the underworld he
                      can be seen as a man with the head of a ram.
                      <br /><br />
                      The sun is the giver of life, controlling the ripening of
                      crops which were worked by man. Because of the life-giving
                      qualities of the sun the Egyptians worshiped the sun as a
                      god. The creator of the universe and the giver of life,
                      the sun or Ra represented life, warmth and growth. Since
                      the people regarded Ra as a principal god, creator of the
                      universe and the source of life, he had a strong influence
                      on them, which led to him being one of the most worshiped
                      of all the Egyptian gods and even considered King of the
                      Gods.
                      <br /><br />
                      At an early period in Egyptian history his influence
                      spread throughout the whole country, bringing multiple
                      representations in form and in name. The most common form
                      combinations are with Atum (his human form), Khepri (the
                      scarab beetle) and Horus (the falcon). The form in which
                      he usually appears is that of a man with a falcon's head,
                      which is due to his combination with Horus, another
                      sky-god. On top of his head sits a solar disc with a
                      cobra, which in many myths represents the eye of Ra.

                      Nut (Ancient Egyptian: Nwt), also known by various other
                      transcriptions, is the goddess of the sky, stars, cosmos,
                      mothers, astronomy, and the universe in the ancient
                      Egyptian religion. She was seen as a star-covered nude
                      woman arching over the Earth, or as a cow. She was
                      depicted wearing the water-pot sign that identifies her.
                      <br /><br />Originally known as the goddess of the night
                      time sky Nut is one of the oldest of the gods; daughter of
                      Shu and Tefnut and is the mother of Set, Osiris, Isis, and
                      Nephthys.<br /><br />
                      Nut has a deep blue body which is covered in stars; she is
                      often depicted as bending over the earth and protecting it
                      along with protecting Ra the Sun God while he travels
                      through the sky, which led to Nut later becoming known as
                      “She who protects”. <br /><br />
                      Nut has also been known as the protector of the dead and
                      was often painted inside a sarcophagus or tomb to protect
                      the deceased.

                      Horus or Her, Heru, Hor, Har in Ancient Egyptian, is one
                      of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities who
                      served many functions, most notably god of kingship and
                      the sky. He was worshipped from at least the late
                      prehistoric Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman
                      Egypt. Different forms of Horus are recorded in history
                      and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists.
                      These various forms may possibly be different
                      manifestations of the same multi-layered deity in which
                      certain attributes or syncretic relationships are
                      emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but
                      complementary to one another, consistent with how the
                      Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality.
                      <br /><br />He was most often depicted as a falcon, most
                      likely a lanner falcon or peregrine falcon, or as a man
                      with a falcon The earliest recorded form of Horus is the
                      tutelary deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt, who is the first
                      known national god, specifically related to the ruling
                      pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation
                      of Horus in life and Osiris in death. <br /><br />The most
                      commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus
                      as the son of Isis and Osiris, and he plays a key role in
                      the Osiris myth as Osiris's heir and the rival to Set, the
                      murderer and brother of Osiris. In another tradition
                      Hathor is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his
                      wife.

                    <p class="card-text text-left">
                      Anubis is the Greek name of the god of death,
                      mummification, embalming, the afterlife, cemeteries,
                      tombs, and the Underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion,
                      usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head.
                      Archeologists have identified Anubis's sacred animal as an
                      Egyptian canid, the African golden wolf. The African wolf
                      was formerly called the "African golden jackal", until a
                      2015 genetic analysis updated the taxonomy and the common
                      name for the species. As a result, Anubis is often
                      referred to as having a "jackal" head, but this "jackal"
                      is now more properly called a "wolf".
                      <br /><br />
                      Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed
                      different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a
                      protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty (c. 3100
                      – c. 2890 BC), Anubis was also an embalmer. By the Middle
                      Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his
                      role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent roles
                      was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He
                      attended the weighing scale during the "Weighing of the
                      Heart", in which it was determined whether a soul would be
                      allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Despite being one
                      of the most ancient and "one of the most frequently
                      depicted and mentioned gods" in the Egyptian pantheon,
                      Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths.
                      <br /><br />
                      Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized
                      regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, and the
                      discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is
                      associated with his brother Wepwawet, another Egyptian god
                      portrayed with a dog's head or in canine form, but with
                      grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures
                      were eventually combined. Anubis' female counterpart is
                      Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Kebechet.

                      Set is a god of deserts, storms, disorder, violence, and
                      foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion. In Ancient Greek,
                      the god's name is given as Sēth (Σήθ). Set had a positive
                      role where he accompanies Ra on his barque to repel Apep,
                      the serpent of Chaos. Set had a vital role as a reconciled
                      combatant. He was lord of the red (desert) land, where he
                      was the balance to Horus' role as lord of the black (soil)
                      land.
                      <br /><br />
                      In the Osiris myth, the most important Egyptian myth, Set
                      is portrayed as the usurper who killed and mutilated his
                      own brother, Osiris. Osiris's wife, Isis, reassembled his
                      corpse and resurrected her dead husband long enough to
                      conceive his son and heir, Horus. Horus sought revenge
                      upon Set and the myths describe their conflicts.
                      <br /><br />
                      In ancient Egyptian astronomy, Set was commonly associated
                      with the planet Mercury.

                      Since he is related to the west of Nile which is the

                      god of the desert which is a deity of a man with a desert
                      determinative on the head.

                      Isis was a major goddess in ancient Egyptian religion
                      whose worship spread throughout the Greco-Roman world.
                      Isis was first mentioned in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181
                      BCE) as one of the main characters of the Osiris myth, in
                      which she resurrects her slain husband, the divine king
                      Osiris, and produces and protects his heir, Horus. She was
                      believed to help the dead enter the afterlife as she had
                      helped Osiris, and she was considered the divine mother of
                      the pharaoh, who was likened to Horus. Her maternal aid
                      was invoked in healing spells to benefit ordinary people.
                      <br /><br />
                      Originally, she played a limited role in royal rituals and
                      temple rites, although she was more prominent in funerary
                      practices and magical texts. She was usually portrayed in
                      art as a human woman wearing a throne-like hieroglyph on
                      her head. During the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE), as
                      she took on traits that originally belonged to Hathor, the
                      preeminent goddess of earlier times, Isis was portrayed
                      wearing Hathor's headdress: a sun disk between the horns
                      of a cow.
                      <br /><br />
                      In the first millennium BCE, Osiris and Isis became the
                      most widely worshipped Egyptian deities, and Isis absorbed
                      traits from many other goddesses. Rulers in Egypt and its
                      neighbor to the south, Nubia, built temples dedicated
                      primarily to Isis, and her temple at Philae was a
                      religious center for Egyptians and Nubians alike. Her
                      reputed magical power was greater than that of all other
                      gods, and she was said to protect the kingdom from its
                      enemies, govern the skies and the natural world, and have
                      power over fate itself.

                      Osiris is the god of fertility, agriculture, the
                      afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation in
                      ancient Egyptian religion. He was classically depicted as
                      a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh's beard, partially
                      mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef
                      crown, and holding a symbolic crook and flail.
                      <br /><br />
                      He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy
                      wrap. When his brother, Set, cut him up into pieces after
                      killing him, Isis, his wife, found all the pieces and
                      wrapped his body up, enabling him to return to life.
                      Osiris was at times considered the eldest son of the earth
                      god Geb and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother
                      and husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his
                      posthumously begotten son. He was also associated with the
                      epithet Khenti-Amentiu, meaning "Foremost of the
                      Westerners", a reference to his kingship in the land of
                      the dead. Through syncretism with Iah, he is also a god of
                      the Moon.
                      <br /><br />
                      Osiris can be considered the brother of Isis, Set,
                      Nephthys, and Horus the Elder, and father of Horus the
                      Younger. The first evidence of the worship of Osiris was
                      found in the middle of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt (25th
                      century BC), although it is likely that he was worshiped
                      much earlier; the Khenti-Amentiu epithet dates to at least
                      the First Dynasty, and was also used as a pharaonic title.
                      Most information available on the Osiris myth is derived
                      from allusions contained in the Pyramid Texts at the end
                      of the Fifth Dynasty, later New Kingdom source documents
                      such as the Shabaka Stone and the "The Contendings of
                      Horus and Seth", and much later, in narrative style from
                      the writings of Greek authors including Plutarch and
                      Diodorus Siculus.
                      <br /><br />
                      Osiris was the judge of the dead and the underworld, and
                      the agency that granted all life, including sprouting
                      vegetation and the fertile flooding of the Nile River. He
                      was described as "He Who is Permanently Benign and
                      Youthful" and the "Lord of Silence". The kings of Egypt
                      were associated with Osiris in death – as Osiris rose from
                      the dead so they would be in union with him, and inherit
                      eternal life through a process of imitative magic.

                      Geb was the Egyptian god of the earth and a mythological
                      member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. he could also be
                      considered a father of snakes. It was believed in ancient
                      Egypt that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he
                      allowed crops to grow.
                      <br /><br />
                      Geb was frequently feared as father of snakes (one of the
                      names for snake was "son of the earth"). In a Coffin Texts
                      spell Geb was described as father of the mythological
                      snake Nehebkau of primeval times. In more mythology, Geb
                      also often occurs as a primeval divine king of Egypt from
                      whom his son Osiris and his grandson Horus inherited the
                      land after many contendings with the disruptive god Set,
                      brother and killer of Osiris. Geb could also be regarded
                      as personified fertile earth and barren desert, the latter
                      containing the dead or setting them free from their tombs,
                      metaphorically described as "Geb opening his jaws", or
                      imprisoning those there not worthy to go to the fertile
                      North-Eastern heavenly Field of Reeds. In the latter case,
                      one of his otherworldly attributes was an ominous
                      jackal-headed stave (called wsr.t Mighty One') rising from
                      the ground onto which enemies could be bound.
                      <br /><br />
                      In the Heliopolitan Ennead (a group of nine gods created
                      in the beginning by the one god Atum or Ra), Geb is the
                      husband of Nut, the sky or visible daytime and nightly
                      firmament, the son of the earlier primordial elements
                      Tefnut (moisture) and Shu ('emptiness'), and the father to
                      the four lesser gods of the system – Osiris, Seth, Isis
                      and Nephthys. In this context, Geb was believed to have
                      originally been engaged with Nut and had to be separated
                      from her by Shu, god of the air. Consequently, in
                      mythological depictions, Geb was shown as a man reclining,
                      sometimes with his phallus still pointed towards Nut. Geb
                      and Nut together formed the permanent boundary between the
                      primeval waters and the newly created world.

                      Nephthys was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. A
                      member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian
                      mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb. Nephthys was
                      typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites[1]
                      because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the
                      god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set.
                      <br /><br />
                      She was associated with mourning, the night/darkness,
                      service (specifically temples), childbirth, the dead,
                      protection, magic, health, embalming, and beer.
                      <br /><br />
                      At the time of the Fifth Dynasty Pyramid Texts, Nephthys
                      appears as a goddess of the Heliopolitan Ennead. She is
                      the sister of Isis and companion of the war-like deity,
                      Set. As sister of Isis and especially Osiris, Nephthys is
                      a protective goddess who symbolizes the death experience,
                      just as Isis represented the birth experience. Nephthys
                      was known in some ancient Egyptian temple theologies and
                      cosmologies as the "Helpful Goddess" or the "Excellent
                      Goddess". These late ancient Egyptian temple texts
                      describe a goddess who represented divine assistance and
                      protective guardianship.
                      <br /><br />
                      Nephthys is regarded as the mother of the funerary deity
                      Anubis (Inpu) in some myths. Alternatively Anubis appears
                      as the son of Bastet or Isis.
                      <br /><br />
                      As the primary "nursing mother" of the incarnate pharaonic
                      god, Horus, Nephthys also was considered to be the nurse
                      of the reigning pharaoh himself. Though other goddesses
                      could assume this role, Nephthys was most usually
                      portrayed in this function. In contrast, Nephthys is
                      sometimes featured as a rather ferocious and dangerous
                      divinity, capable of incinerating the enemies of the
                      pharaoh with her fiery breath.

                      Shu was one of the primordial Egyptian gods, spouse and
                      brother to goddess Tefnut, and one of the nine deities of
                      the Ennead of the Heliopolis cosmogony. He was the god of
                      peace, lions, air, and wind.
                      <br /><br />
                      As the air, Shu was considered to be a cooling, and thus
                      calming, influence, and pacifier. Due to the association
                      with dry air, calm, and thus Ma'at (truth, justice, order,
                      and balance), Shu was depicted as the dry air/atmosphere
                      between the earth and sky, separating the two realms after
                      the event of the First Occasion. Shu was also portrayed in
                      art as wearing an ostrich feather. Shu was seen with
                      between one and four feathers. The ostrich feather was
                      symbolic of lightness and emptiness. Fog and clouds were
                      also Shu's elements and they were often called his bones.
                      Because of his position between the sky and earth, he was
                      also known as the wind.

                      In a much later myth, representing a terrible weather
                      disaster at the end of the Old Kingdom, it was said that
                      Tefnut and Shu once argued, and Tefnut left Egypt for
                      Nubia (which was always more temperate). It was said that
                      Shu quickly decided that he missed her, but she changed
                      into a cat that destroyed any man or god that approached.
                      Thoth, disguised, eventually succeeded in convincing her
                      to return.

                      Bastet was a goddess of ancient Egyptian religion,
                      worshiped as early as the Second Dynasty (2890 BCE).
                      Bastet was worshiped in Bubastis in Lower Egypt,
                      originally as a lioness goddess, a role shared by other
                      deities such as Sekhmet. Eventually Bastet and Sekhmet
                      were characterized as two aspects of the same goddess,
                      with Sekhmet representing the powerful warrior and
                      protector aspect and Bastet, who increasingly was depicted
                      as a cat, representing a gentler aspect.
                      <br /><br />
                      She was also depicted as the daughter of Ra and Isis, and
                      the consort of Ptah, with whom she had a son Maahes.
                      <br /><br />
                      As protector of Lower Egypt, she was seen as defender of
                      the king, and consequently of the sun god, Ra. Along with
                      other deities such as Hathor, Sekhmet, and Isis, Bastet
                      was associated with the Eye of Ra. She has been depicted
                      as fighting the evil snake named Apep, an enemy of Ra. In
                      addition to her solar connections, sometimes she was
                      called "eye of the moon".
                      <br /><br />
                      Bastet was also a goddess of pregnancy and childbirth,
                      possibly because of the fertility of the domestic cat.
                      <br /><br />
                      Images of Bastet were often created from alabaster. The
                      goddess was sometimes depicted holding a ceremonial
                      sistrum in one hand and an aegis in the other—the aegis
                      usually resembling a collar or gorget, embellished with a
                      lioness head.
                      <br /><br />
                      Bastet was also depicted as the goddess of protection
                      against contagious diseases and evil spirits.

                      Serket is the goddess of fertility, nature, animals,
                      medicine, magic, and healing venomous stings and bites in
                      Egyptian mythology, originally the deification of the
                      scorpion. Her family life is unknown, but she is sometimes
                      credited as the daughter of Neith and Khnum, making her a
                      sister to Sobek and Apep.
                      <br /><br />
                      Scorpion stings lead to paralysis and Serket's name
                      describes this, as it means "(she who) tightens the
                      throat"; however, Serket's name also can be read as
                      meaning "(she who) causes the throat to breathe", and so,
                      as well as being seen as stinging the unrighteous, Serket
                      was seen as one who could cure scorpion stings and the
                      effects of other venoms such as snakebites.
                      <br /><br />
                      In the art of ancient Egypt, Serket was shown as a
                      scorpion (a symbol found on the earliest artifacts of the
                      culture, such as from Naqada III) or as a woman with a
                      scorpion on her head. Although Serket does not appear to
                      have had any temples, she had a sizable number of priests
                      in many communities.
                      <br /><br />
                      One of the most dangerous species of scorpion, the
                      Deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus) resides in North
                      Africa, and its sting may kill, so Serket was considered a
                      highly important goddess, and sometimes she was considered
                      by pharaohs to be their patron. Her close association with
                      the early rulers implies that she was their protector,
                      notably Scorpion I and Scorpion II.
                      <br /><br />
                      As the protector against venom and snakebite, Serket often
                      was said to protect the deities from Apep, the great
                      snake-demon of evil, sometimes being depicted as the guard
                      when Apep was captured.
