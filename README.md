## Gods Of Egypt
Gods of Egypt is an educational website that provides information on the myths of ancient Egyptian gods such as Ra, Nephthys, and Horus.

Each of the gods listed has their own information box containing a brief description of what type of god they are, how they were worshipped, and who they are related to.

There is also an illustration of the god and information about how they were depicted in history; sometimes in human or semi-human form and other times as animals.

The site is fully responsive and uses Bootstrap for the layout.
